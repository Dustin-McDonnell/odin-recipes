<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Redberry pies are a type of pie that can be obtained 
    by baking an uncooked berry pie on a cooking range,
     requiring level 10 Cooking and granting 78 experience when successful. 
     Players may burn the pie while baking one, resulting in a burnt pie;
      the burn rate while cooking these will decrease as players reach higher Cooking levels.
       It will stop burning entirely at Cooking level 45 on ranges. 
       Alternatively, casting the Bake Pie spell from the lunar spellbook 
       guarantees successful baking of all pies.
